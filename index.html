        <h1 style="background-color: red;">My deadliest journey</h1>
        <p>It sounds crazy I know but this is the reality. If I fail this time, I will forget about <em>IT completely</em>. What determines my <strong style="color: red;">failure</strong> or <strong style="color: green;">success</strong> here? If I can't <u style="font-size: 15px;">earn money</u> this time with my coding skills, it will be my failure and if I can earn <em>even</em> a <strong style="color: yellow;">penny</strong>, it will be my success. But there is another questions, how long I will continue my this journey? I will continue my this journey until I complete the six months subcription on scrimba and after completing the the frontend career path and two react courses, I will give myself six months to earn even a penny for continuing my career as a IT professional.</p>
        
        <h2 style="background-color: blue; color: red;">Why I am so serious this time?</h2>
        <p>The answer is <em>why</em> I am here leaving country, leaving my country people, leaving my <em>family</em>, why I am here, in the united states of <em>America</em>, for working at <strong style="color: orange;">POPEYES</strong> as a food handler! Definitely not. </p>
        <p>Then why I am here? <strong style="color: red;">Why?</strong>ðŸ˜  The straight-forward answer is making a remarkable career what <em>Sayeed</em> vai reminded me today at work.</p>
        
        <h2 style="background-color: green;">Will I be able to do it?</h2>
        <p>There is no one-line answer for this question because what Allah has written for me I don't know. As a <em>believer</em>, I believe whatever how much I try it doesn't even matter if Allah doesn't help me. But if I try my <strong>level best</strong> and if I ask <strong>Allah's help</strong>, Allah will <em>definitely</em> help me. And if Allah doesn't choose IT as my career then it is best to leave IT after this journey ends and do something else. But my Allah knows how much I am craving for becoming an IT professional.

        <p>It's easy to get depressed but with Allah's help there is <a href="hope.html" style="color: green;">hope</a></p>
