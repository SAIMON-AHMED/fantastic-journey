        <h1 style="background-color: blue; color: white;">Hope is the comes from Allah's blessings</h1>
        <p>I am truly hopefull, Allah will help me and I will be an IT professional because from the history of my life I can say how many times I tried hard and soul and asked Allah's help I became successful and Allah always made at one way to become successful. Allah will definitely help me and I will be successful.</p>
        
        <h2 style="background-color: orange;">How to continue the journey?</h2>
        <p>To continue this journey, I need money. I need time and energy. To earn, I have Popeyes and Bookkeeping. So which one should I choose? If I choose Popeyes, I will be tired after work but it will incite me to prepare myself for IT and if I choose Bookkeeping, it will save my physical energy but it will distract me from doing coding alone and it might make me lazy. So which one should I choose?</p> 
        
        <p>I will choose bookkeeping because distraction and inciting can be managed easily with willpower but it is too hard to manage physical energy with willpower. And if your body doesn't support you, it is not easy to become successful. But it doesn't mean that I will sleep 8 hours or more from now. I will count my every single moment because this is the last chance to become an IT professional.</p>
